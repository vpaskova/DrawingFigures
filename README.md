3. This is the window we use to create a triangle. Here we can choose its size and color. Sizes must be positive integers. In case of entering incorrect values, an error message is displayed and the user will be asked to enter valid values. Also for the triangle, if its entered sides cannot form an existing one, the user will be notified so that he can select new values.
